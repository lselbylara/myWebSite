	Mort is a character from the Madagascar series that has really inspired me to be a more positive person. no matter what, More is always happy. Mort has gone through struggles throughout the series but has always worked through them
 in a positive manner. He has two main friends which are king Julian and Maurice. Mort's goal is always to make king Julian happy in any way possible which shows how selfless mort truly is. Mort also is very resilient in an inspiring 
 way no matter how mean king Julian is to him he never gives up or even seems to start to crack. The perseverance Mort shows is inspiring.
