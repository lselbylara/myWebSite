	write an algorithim to create a guessing game 
	let the user know if the guess is to high or too low.
	if they guess the number, alert this fact and telll them how many guesses
	it took them to goess the number

	1.first we have to create a random number generator of intigers 1-10
	2.then have that conect to a prompt that makes the user imput and guess /loop when they dont guess the answer
	3.then we have to have that user imput checked with the number that the random generator out put
	4. then ifnorm the user if thier guess was coreect, to high, or too low 
	5. then the user has to imput a number based off the information given wether too hgih ot too low but if its coreect they dont guess agsin
	6. then it has to check with the original generated number
